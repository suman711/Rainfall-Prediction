# Rainfall Prediction
This project predicts rainfall occurrence based on meteorological parameters such as pressure, dewpoint, humidity, cloud cover, sunshine, wind direction and wind speed. The application integrates a machine learning model for accurate predictions with a user-friendly web interface.

# Features
1. Predicts rainfall occurrence using a trained machine learning model
2. Intuitive web interface for inputting weather parameters
3. Flask-based backend for serving predictions
4. Model versioning with MLflow for efficient updates and tracking

# Tech Stack
1. Python: Backend server and model development
2. scikit-learn: Machine learning library used for training the predictive model
3. Flask: REST API for serving predictions
4. HTML/CSS & Bootstrap: Responsive user interface for parameter input and results display
5. MLflow: Model deployment and version management

# Usage
Input weather data (e.g., pressure, humidity, cloud cover) into the provided form
Click on the Predict button
View the result: "Rainfall" or "No Rainfall"
